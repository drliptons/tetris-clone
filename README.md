<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project
Tetris is a classical puzzle game created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. I think I don't need to talk more about what 
Tetris is. Everyone knows that game. Who doesn't? This Tetris clone version was included with most of the basic 
functionalities of its original version. I intended to make this as a single script. Somehow the code getting longer 
and I've stopped before it's getting too long.
